# Follow the following instruction in order to run the code on your system

1.First Install Python 3.0 on your system from the link below
https://www.python.org/downloads/

Then go into the folder where you have install the python. For me it is in 
C:\Users\LENOVO\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36-32\Scripts

Note:-> if you are using the windows then enable the option show hidden files because AppData is hidden in windows 
     -> LENOVO is my username 

2.Start CMD at this path and type the following commands 
  a. First we install the Virtual Environment
     -> pip install virtualenv

3. Now we setup the environment for our project 
  a. Go to the disk on which you want to create the folder. for ex.
     ->cd F:/Flask
     ->mkdir example1
     ->cd example1
     ->virtual venv(instead of venv you can have any name that you want)
     ->cd venv

4. Now minimise the cmd

5. Now copy the folder that I have provided to you in the venv

6. Now open the cmd and type following
  -> cd /Scripts
  -> activate 
  Now once you see venv in parenthis like (venv) it means virtual environment has been activated then type folowing command
  -> pip install flask (let the flask to be download)
  -> cd ../week1task
  -> python app.py  
  
  7.Then it will show the url on which it is running server.Go into your favourite browser and then type the url shown
  
  Go Into following url's (you have to type the url shown in the cmd to you instead of lodalhost:5000/)
